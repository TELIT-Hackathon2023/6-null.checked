    "summary": "The State Bar of California is seeking proposals to redesign and redevelop their public-facing website, with a focus on accessibility, modernization, and optimization for mobile and other devices. The current website is outdated and does not meet the latest accessibility standards. The objective of the project is to create an accessible and aesthetically pleasing website with intuitive navigation. Key requirements include improving navigation, search capabilities, and mobile compatibility. The website serves three primary target audiences: Bar applicants, members, and the public. It provides various services and information for each constituency. The website is currently hosted at the State of California's Office of Technology Services and uses the DotNetNuke content management system. The programming language is C#.Net, and the databases used are MS SQL and IBM DB2. The website receives the majority of its traffic from the United States, with other traffic coming from Canada, the Philippines, the UK, and India. The majority of users access the website on desktop/laptop devices, followed by mobile and tablet devices. The most commonly used browsers are Chrome, IE, Safari, and Firefox. The website is currently only available in English, but the search feature supports all languages. The website needs to be ADA compliant based on WCAG guidelines. The project goals and objectives include improving accessibility, navigation, search engine optimization, and overall user experience. The deliverables of the project include a Proof-of-Concept design, analysis of navigation and site architecture, accessible design evaluation, search engine optimization recommendations, content strategy recommendations, visual design, front-end coding, site map, wireframes, HTML/CSS templates, style guide, email template, and user testing and analysis.",
