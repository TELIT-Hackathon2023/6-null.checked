    "1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis document is a reposted Request for Proposal (“RFP”) for the State Bar of California’s Website Redesign. \nPlease note the new  Frequently Asked Questions attached to this document.  \nThe State Bar of California is seeking proposals to redesign and redevelop its public-facing website to ensure that it \nis accessible to persons with disabilities and to modernize its look and feel and optimize for mobile and other \ndevices. Other goals include enhancing its overall online presence and experience with use of the latest web \ntechnologies and facilitating content management while meeting high standards for accessibility, design quality and \nvisual appeal.  \nThe State Bar web redesign project requires Information Architecture, a redesign of the UI, and HTML/CSS \ntemplates. Though our site functions in part through a DotNetNuke CMS, implementation of templates will be done \nwith in-house development resources and is not a requirement of the vendor for this project.  This project does not \ninclude a migration from DNN, though a firm with familiarity with that platform would be a plus, being able to \nadvise aspects of implementation.This RFP does not cover site hosting, domain registration or domain name service. \nPlease submit seven (7) copies of your proposal no later than 4 p.m. on September 18, 2015 to: \nThe State Bar of California \n180 Howard Street \nSan Francisco, CA  94105-1639 \nAttn: Ken Coffelt \nCommunications \n(415) 538-2096 \nKen.Coffelt@calbar.ca.gov \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe State Bar of California (“the State Bar”) created in 1927 by the Legislature and adopted into the \nCalifornia Constitution in 1960, is a public corporation within the judicial branch of state government.  The \npurpose of the State Bar of California is to ensure that the people of California are served by the legal \nprofession in a manner consistent with the highest standards of professional competence, care, and ethical \nconduct; to carry out such additional programs as may b",
    "e required by law or by rule of court; and to \ncontribute generally to the science of jurisprudence and the administration of justice.  The State Bar serves \nas an administrative adjunct to the California Supreme Court in all matters pertaining to the admission, \ndiscipline, and regulation of California lawyers.  The California Constitution, the State Bar Act and \nCalifornia Rules of Court vest in the State Bar the duty to regulate the legal profession, formulate and \nelevate educational and professional standards, raise the quality of legal services, advance the science of \njurisprudence, and aid in the improvement of the administration of justice. \nThe State Bar is a unified, or integrated bar, and membership is mandatory for all attorneys who are \nlicensed to practice law in the state.  In addition to its mandated licensing, disciplinary and certification \nfunctions, the State Bar offers a number of other programs designed to assist, educate and protect its \nmembers and the public.  Fees paid by attorneys and applicants to practice law finance the State Bar’s \nprograms.  The State Bar has over 253,000 members, making it the largest unified state bar in the country \nwith offices located in Los Angeles and San Francisco.  For more than 80 years, The State Bar of California \nhas shaped the development of the law, regulated the professional conduct of the state’s lawyers and \nprovided greater access to the justice system for all citizens.  More information about the organization can \nbe found at http://www.calbar.ca.gov/AboutUs.aspx. \n2 \n \n \nII. \nStatement of Work \nA. \nBackground \nThe State Bar’s website was originally released in 2003 and has gone through several redesigns, \nculminating in the current website released in 2010.   In 2010, the State Bar began requiring that \nall documents placed on the State Bar’s websites be accessible to person with disabilities.  In \n2012, the State Bar adopted a policy that required all electronic and information technology to be ",
    "\naccessible to persons with disabilities and for it to meet the World Wide Web Consortium’s \n(W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), version 2.0. The current website  design \nand content delivers large amounts of regulatory and archival information.  While the website has \nmet the needs of the Bar, it has not kept up with the latest standards that ensure that the website is \naccessible to persons with disabilities and the latest technological advances that are important to \nour members and visitors making the site difficult to navigate and search, too many outdated \npages,  and not designed for mobility and viewing on mobile devices. \nThe redesign will facilitate content delivery – including facilitating views on mobile devices – that \nsupport the bar’s web communication strategy for its users. The Bar serves three primary target \naudiences—Bar applicants, members, and the public. All of these constituencies contain persons \nwith disabilities. \n1. \nApplicants \na. \naccess information about the California Bar Examinations, \nb. obtain and submit applications and admission forms, and  \nc. \ntrack their progress in the admissions process. \n2. \nMembers \na. \nmaintain their contact information on My State Bar Profile, \nb. pay fees, \nc. \nfile mandatory reports,  \nd. report completion of State Bar-mandated continuing legal education requirements,  \ne. \naccess information on and participate in areas of legal specialties through the \nSections & Education portals \n3. \nPublic users \na. \nsearch for an attorney \nb. find legal information in multiple languages \nc. \nobtain attorney referral services, \nd. file complaints against attorneys \ne. \nlocate attorney contact information and discipline history \nf. \nobtain printable forms and materials (some in multiple languages) \ng. access public documents, such as agendas, public comments and reports \nh. locate historical information regarding the State Bar and officials \nIn addition, the website serves as a tool for the bar to dis",
    "seminate information and news to the larger legal \ncommunity in the state, including judges, legislators and legal organizations. It is where the bar’s official \npublication, the California Bar Journal is published. \nB. \nCurrent Environment \nThe current portal consists of 19 websites in a DotNetNuke (DNN) content management system \nand will continue to use DNN CMS throughout this project. \nWebsite Layout \n3 \n \n \nTitle \nPortal Aliases \nPages \nAdmissions of The State Bar of California \nadmissions.calbar.ca.gov \n99 \nAntitrust \nantitrust.calbar.ca.gov \n46 \nBusiness Law \nbusinesslaw.calbar.ca.gov \n390 \nCalbar Connect \nwww.calbarconnect.com \n97 \nCalifornia Legal Specialists \nls.calbar.ca.gov \n62 \nCalifornia Young Lawyers Association \ncyla.calbar.ca.gov \n49 \nCommittees and Commissions \ncc.calbar.ca.gov \n98 \nCriminal Law \ncriminallaw.calbar.ca.gov \n57 \nEnvironmental Law \nenvironmental.calbar.ca.gov \n63 \nEthics \nethics.calbar.ca.gov \n104 \nFamily Law \nfamilylaw.calbar.ca.gov \n84 \nSections of The State Bar of California \nsections.calbar.ca.gov \n107 \nSolo and Small Firm \nsolo.calbar.ca.gov \n44 \nTaxation \ntaxation.calbar.ca.gov \n88 \nThe California Bar Journal \nwww.calbarjournal.com \n158\n6 \nThe State Bar Court of California \nwww.statebarcourt.ca.gov \n64 \nThe State Bar of California \nwww.calbar.ca.gov \n875 \nTrusts and Estates \ntrustslaw.calbar.ca.gov \n95 \nWorkers Compensation \nworkerscomp.calbar.ca.gov \n49 \nPage counts do not include linked documents like PDFs, MS Word Docs and images.

The State Bar may also have \ndiscussions with those bidders falling within a competitive range, request revised pricing offers \nfrom such bidders, and make an award and/or conduct negotiations thereafter.  \nThis Request for Proposal does not commit the State Bar to awarding a contract.  Bidders shall \nbear all costs incurred in the preparation of the Proposal and participating in the Proposal \nevaluation process.  The State Bar reserves the right to reject any and all Proposals, to accept the \nProposal it considers most favorable in its sole discretion, and to waive minor irregularities.  The \n12 \n \n \nState Bar further reserves the right to seek new Proposals when such procedure is considered by it \nto be in the best interest of the State Bar.  \n1. \nThe following criteria will be used in reviewing and comparing the proposals and in \ndetermining the HSB.  The weight to be assigned to each criterion appears following each \nitem. \na. \nResponsiveness of the proposal to the submission requirements set forth in the \nRFP (5%). \nb. \nAgreement with the State Bar’s contracting requirements (5%). \nc. \nThe technical ability, capacity, and flexibility of the bidder to perform the \ncontract in a timely manner and on budget, as verified by, the quality of any \ndemonstration, client references, demonstrated success in projects with similar \nrequirements and any other contracts with the State Bar (50%). \nd. \nThe total cost of the proposal.  If the proposal contains itemized rates, per piece \npricing, or commission-based pricing, the State Bar re",
    "serves the right to \ncalculate total contracted cost by calculating rates using either previous known \nusage activity or future projected volume.  Costs will be evaluated only if a \nproposal is determined to be otherwise qualified.  Costs should be itemized by \ntype to allow the State Bar to implement the proposal over the term of the \ncontract (40%). \n2. \nIf a large number of proposals are received, the State Bar reserves the right to review the \nproposals using a tiered evaluation system.  All qualified proposals will be evaluated \nbased on the Submission Requirements and Cost, with the top candidates advancing as \nfinalists and receiving a full evaluation as outlined above. \nE. \nAward and Execution of Contract \nSubject to the State Bar’s right to reject any or all proposals, the HSB will be awarded the \ncontract.  Notice will be posted at the State Bar’s offices at 180 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA \nand written notice sent to bidders on or about October 16, 2015 of the Bar’s intention to award the \ncontract to the HSB.  It is anticipated that final selection of the HSB will be made by October 23, \n2015.  The evaluation team will select a winning proposal subject to approval by the Board of \nTrustees.  Upon selection, the State Bar and the selected Vendor will enter into good faith \nnegotiations on a contract containing, without limitation, the Statement of Work and Contracting \nRequirements sections below. \nNo contract or agreement, express or implied, shall exist or be binding on the State Bar before the \nexecution of a written contract by both parties.  If agreement on the terms of such a contract \ncannot be reached after a period deemed reasonable by the State Bar in its sole discretion, the State \nBar may enter into negotiations and sign a contract with any other bidder who submitted timely \nand responsive proposals to this RFP.  \nIf, after the State Bar and the HSB agree to terms and execute a contract, that contract is \nterminated for any reason, the Sta",
    "te Bar may, in its sole discretion, either enter into negotiations \nwith the next highest scored bidder, or issue a new RFP and begin the proposal process anew. \nQuestions regarding the State Bar’s award of any business on the basis of proposals submitted in \nresponse to the RFP, or on any other matter in connection with the selection process, should be \naddressed in writing to Andrew Conover, Procurement Director at \nandrew.conover@calbar.ca.gov. \n13 \n \n \nWhere written notice is required in this RFP, the notice must be sent by U.S. mail and either \nfacsimile or e-mail. \nF. \nErrors in the RFP \nIf a bidder discovers any ambiguity, conflict, discrepancy, omission, or other error in the RFP, the \nbidder should immediately provide the State Bar with written notice of the problem and request \nthat the RFP be clarified or modified.  Without disclosing the source of the request, the State Bar \nmay modify the document prior to the date fixed for submission of proposals by issuing an \naddendum to all potential bidders to whom the RFP was sent. \nIf prior to the date fixed for submissions, a bidder knows of or should have known of an error in \nthe RFP but fails to notify the State Bar of the error, the bidder shall bid at its own risk, and if, \nawarded the contract, shall not be entitled to additional compensation or time by reason of the \nerror or its later correction. \nG. \nQuestions Regarding the RFP \nQuestions regarding the RFP may be addressed in writing to to Ken Coffelt at \nken.coffelt@calbar.ca.gov.  All questions must be submitted no later than 10 days prior to the date \n14 \n \n \nfor submission of proposals.  Questions and answers regarding the RFP may be shared with all \nbidders known to be interested in submitting a proposal. \nIf a question relates to a proprietary aspect of its proposal and the question would expose \nproprietary information if disclosed to competitors, the bidder may submit the question in writing, \nconspicuously marking it as \"CONFIDENTIAL.\"  With t",
    "he question, the bidder must submit a \nstatement explaining why the question is sensitive.  If the State Bar concurs that the disclosure of \nthe question or answer would expose proprietary information, the question will be answered, and \nboth the question and answer will be kept in confidence.  If the State Bar does not concur \nregarding the proprietary nature of the question, the question will not be answered in this manner \nand the bidder will be notified. \nA bidder who believes that one or more of the RFP’s requirements is onerous or unfair, or \nunnecessarily precludes less costly or alternative solutions, may submit a written request that the \nRFP be changed.  The request must set forth the recommended change and reason for proposing \nthe change.  The State Bar must receive any such request no later than 5 days before the deadline \nfor submitting proposals. \nH. \nAddenda \nThe State Bar may modify the RFP prior to the fixed date for submission by posting, mailing, \nemailing or faxing an addendum to the bidders known to be interested in submitting a proposal.  If \nany bidder determines that an addendum unnecessarily restricts its ability to bid, it must notify the \nState Bar in writing no later than five (5) days before the deadline for submitting proposals. \nI. \nWithdrawal and Resubmission/Modification of Proposals \nA proposal may be withdrawn at any time prior to the deadline for submitting proposals by \nnotifying the State Bar in writing of its withdrawal.  The notice must be signed by the bidder.  The \nbidder may thereafter submit a new or modified proposal, provided that it is received at the State \nBar no later than the deadline. \nModification offered in any other manner, oral or written, will not be considered.  Proposals \ncannot be changed after the evaluation process begins. \nJ. \nProtest Procedure \nA bidder may protest the award if it meets all the following conditions: \n1. \nThe bidder has submitted a proposal that it believes is or should have been the HS",
    "B, \nunder the criteria set forth above; \n2. \nThe bidder believes that its proposal meets the State Bar's administrative and technical \nrequirements, proposes services of proven quality and performance, and offers a \ncompetitive cost to the State Bar; and \n3. \nThe bidder believes that the State Bar has incorrectly selected another bidder. \nA bidder qualified to protest should contact Andrew Conover, Procurement Director, (415) 538-\n2207, to attempt an informal resolution.  If this contact is unable to resolve the protest to the \nbidder's satisfaction, the bidder must file a written protest within 5 days of the notice of intention \nto award the contract.  The written protest must state the facts surrounding the issue and the \nreasons the bidder believes the award to be invalid.  The protest must be sent by certified or \nregistered mail or delivered personally to: \nThe State Bar of California \n180 Howard Street \nSan Francisco, CA 94105-1639 \nAttention:  Chief Financial Officer \nProtests will be reviewed and decided by the State Bar’s Award Protest Team within 30 days after \nthe State Bar issues written acknowledgment of the protest.

Termination will be in \naddition to any other rights or remedies that the State Bar may have under the final \nAgreement. \n20 \n \n \n9. \nIf Vendor assigns, subcontracts, or delegates any portion of the duties under the final \nAgreement, Vendor will ensure that each assignee, subvendor, or delegee purchases and \nmaintains the same insurance coverage required pursuant to the final Agreement, \nprovided however, that nothing herein will be construed as permitting Vendor to assign, \nsubcontract or delegate any portion of the duties under the Agreement without the State \nBar’s prior written consent. \nG. \nTermination \n1. \nTermination.  The State Bar may terminate the final Agreement, in its sole discretion, \n21 \n \n \nwithout cause and for any reason upon seven (7) days’ written notice to Vendor, such \ntermination effective upon",

If the term of the final Agreement extends beyond the fiscal \nyear in effect when the final Agreement was entered into by the Parties, Vendor \nacknowledges that continuation of the final Agreement may be subject to annual funding \nthrough the state legislative process.  In such event, if funds to effect the continuation of \nthe Term are not appropriated, Vendor shall commence and perform, with diligence, all \nactions necessary on the part of Vendor to effect the termination of the final Agreement \non the date specified by the Authorized Representative and to minimize the liability of \nVendor and the State Bar to third parties as a result of termination, including, without \nlimitation, accepting the return from the State Bar of any affected equipment, products, \nsoftware or hardware furnished under the final Agreemen",
