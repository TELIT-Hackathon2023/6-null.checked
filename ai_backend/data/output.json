    "This document is a reposted Request for Proposal (“RFP”) for the State Bar of California’s Website Redesign. Please note the new Frequently Asked Questions attached to this document. The State Bar of California is seeking proposals to redesign and redevelop its public-facing website to ensure that it is accessible to persons with disabilities and to modernize its look and feel and optimize for mobile and other devices. Other goals include enhancing its overall online presence and experience with use of the latest web technologies and facilitating content management while meeting high standards for accessibility, design quality and visual appeal. The State Bar web redesign project requires Information Architecture, a redesign of the UI, and HTML/CSS templates. Though our site functions in part through a DotNetNuke CMS, implementation of templates will be done with in-house development resources and is not a requirement of the vendor for this project. This project does not include a migration from DNN, though a firm with familiarity with that platform would be a plus, being able to advise aspects of implementation.This RFP does not cover site hosting, domain registration or domain name service. Please submit seven () copies of your proposal no later than  p.m. on September ,  to: The State Bar of California  Howard Street San Francisco, CA - Attn: Ken Coffelt Communications () -  I. INTRODUCTION The State Bar of California (“the State Bar”) created in  by the Legislature and adopted into the California Constitution in , is a public corporation within the judicial branch of state government. The purpose of the State Bar of California is to ensure that the people of California are served by the legal profession in a manner consistent with the highest standards of professional competence, care, and ethical conduct; to carry out such additional programs as may b",
    "e required by law or by rule of court; and to contribute generally to the science of jurisprudence and the administration of justice. The State Bar serves as an administrative adjunct to the California Supreme Court in all matters pertaining to the admission, discipline, and regulation of California lawyers. The California Constitution, the State Bar Act and California Rules of Court vest in the State Bar the duty to regulate the legal profession, formulate and elevate educational and professional standards, raise the quality of legal services, advance the science of jurisprudence, and aid in the improvement of the administration of justice. The State Bar is a unified, or integrated bar, and membership is mandatory for all attorneys who are licensed to practice law in the state. In addition to its mandated licensing, disciplinary and certification functions, the State Bar offers a number of other programs designed to assist, educate and protect its members and the public. Fees paid by attorneys and applicants to practice law finance the State Bar’s programs. The State Bar has over , members, making it the largest unified state bar in the country with offices located in Los Angeles and San Francisco. For more than  years, The State Bar of California has shaped the development of the law, regulated the professional conduct of the state’s lawyers and provided greater access to the justice system for all citizens. More information about the organization can be found at II. Statement of Work A. Background The State Bar’s website was originally released in  and has gone through several redesigns, culminating in the current website released in . In , the State Bar began requiring that all documents placed on the State Bar’s websites be accessible to person with disabilities. In , the State Bar adopted a policy that required all electronic and information technology to be",
    "accessible to persons with disabilities and for it to meet the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), version .. The current website design and content delivers large amounts of regulatory and archival information. While the website has met the needs of the Bar, it has not kept up with the latest standards that ensure that the website is accessible to persons with disabilities and the latest technological advances that are important to our members and visitors making the site difficult to navigate and search, too many outdated pages, and not designed for mobility and viewing on mobile devices. The redesign will facilitate content delivery – including facilitating views on mobile devices – that support the bar’s web communication strategy for its users. The Bar serves three primary target audiences—Bar applicants, members, and the public. All of these constituencies contain persons with disabilities. . Applicants a. access information about the California Bar Examinations, b. obtain and submit applications and admission forms, and c. track their progress in the admissions process. . Members a. maintain their contact information on My State Bar Profile, b. pay fees, c. file mandatory reports, d. report completion of State Bar-mandated continuing legal education requirements, e. access information on and participate in areas of legal specialties through the Sections and Education portals .

If specific submission components are particularly large and self-contained they may be included in a separate appendix rather than in the body of the proposal.

The State Bar may or may not waive an immaterial deviation or defect in a proposal. The State Bar's waiver of an immaterial deviation or defect will in no way modify the RFP or excuse a bidder from full compliance with the RFP requirements. Any proposal may be rejected where it is determined to be not really competitive, or where the cost is not reasonable. Proposals that contain false or misleading statements may be rejected if in the State Bar's opinion the information was intended to mislead the State Bar regarding a requirement of the RFP. D.

The State Bar reserves the right to determine the suitability of proposals on the basis of a",
    "proposal's meeting administrative requirements, technical requirements, the review team's assessment of the quality and performance of the equipment and services proposed, and cost. During the evaluation process, the State Bar may require a bidder’s representative to answer questions with regard to the proposal and/or require certain bidders to make a formal presentation to the evaluation team and/or the State Bar Senior Executive Team. The State Bar may also have discussions with those bidders falling within a competitive range, request revised pricing offers from such bidders, and make an award and/or conduct negotiations thereafter. This Request for Proposal does not commit the State Bar to awarding a contract. Bidders shall bear all costs incurred in the preparation of the Proposal and participating in the Proposal evaluation process. The State Bar reserves the right to reject any and all Proposals, to accept the Proposal it considers most favorable in its sole discretion, and to waive minor irregularities. The  State Bar further reserves the right to seek new Proposals when such procedure is considered by it to be in the best interest of the State Bar. .

The technical ability, capacity, and flexibility of the bidder to perform the contract in a timely manner and on budget, as verified by, the quality of any demonstration, client references, demonstrated success in projects with similar requirements and any other contracts with the State Bar (%). d. The total cost of the proposal. If the proposal contains itemized rates, per piece pricing, or commission-based pricing, the State Bar re",
    "serves the right to calculate total contracted cost by calculating rates using either previous known usage activity or future projected volume. Costs will be evaluated only if a proposal is determined to be otherwise qualified. Costs should be itemized by type to allow the State Bar to implement the proposal over the term of the contract (%). . If a large number of proposals are received, the State Bar reserves the right to review the proposals using a tiered evaluation system. All qualified proposals will be evaluated based on the Submission Requirements and Cost, with the top candidates advancing as finalists and receiving a full evaluation as outlined above. E.

No contract or agreement, express or implied, shall exist or be binding on the State Bar before the execution of a written contract by both parties. If agreement on the terms of such a contract cannot be reached after a period deemed reasonable by the State Bar in its sole discretion, the State Bar may enter into negotiations and sign a contract with any other bidder who submitted timely and responsive proposals to this RFP. If, after the State Bar and the HSB agree to terms and execute a contract, that contract is terminated for any reason, the Sta",
    "te Bar may, in its sole discretion, either enter into negotiations with the next highest scored bidder, or issue a new RFP and begin the proposal process anew.

Without disclosing the source of the request, the State Bar may modify the document prior to the date fixed for submission of proposals by issuing an addendum to all potential bidders to whom the RFP was sent. If prior to the date fixed for submissions, a bidder knows of or should have known of an error in the RFP but fails to notify the State Bar of the error, the bidder shall bid at its own risk, and if, awarded the contract, shall not be entitled to additional compensation or time by reason of the error or its later correction.
