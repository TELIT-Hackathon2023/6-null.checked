    "n this Section do not reduce any liability the Contractor has assumed under this Contract including any indemnification or hold harmless requirements.

For example: If the required policy limit under this Contract is for two million dollars ($,,) in coverage, acceptable coverage would include a specific policy covering one million dollars ($,,) combined with an umbrella policy for an additional one million dollars ($,,). If the deficient underlying policy is for a coverage area without aggregate limits (generally Automobile Liability and Employers’ Liability Accident), Contractor shall provide a copy of the umbrella insurance policy documents to ensure that no aggregate limit applies to the umbrella policy for that coverage area.

Instead Contractor shall provide a certificate of self-insurance or a letter, on Contractor’s letterhead, detailing its coverage, policy amounts, and proof of funds to reasonably cover such expenses. The State reserves the right to require complete copies of all required insurance policies, including endorsements required by these specifications, at any time.
